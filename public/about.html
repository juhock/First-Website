<p>Welcome, my name is Julia Hocken! I studied Psychology and Human Development & Family Studies at Penn State University and earned a Masters degree in Psychology with a graduate certificate in Addiction studies. </p>

<p>I am currently living in Minnesota, self-teaching coding in order to puruse my goal to become a software engineer. This site was created to showcase my projects and abilities.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or would like to get in contact, please visit my contact page! Thanks and hope you have a great day :) </p>
